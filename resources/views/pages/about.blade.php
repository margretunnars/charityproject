	    <h3>About us</h3>
	    <p>As and When brings people together with the purpose of giving and receiving help. It is organized around one simple idea: When we get together and use our skills to make our community better, we're at our best. The As and When Foundation makes it possible for people to contribute to their community in their convenient time, without a time schedule or date. </p>
	    <p>There is always someone in need for your help and skill. Why not give back when you have extra time?</p>
